This extension was modified for my prefered browser so that it will flash in a particular area of Facebook and LinkedIn. Your browser might be different. 

The first pop-up box will ask you for a postion for the flash, and the second will ask for the desired color. You can iterate through either. The defalut setting is for a blank area on the Facebook page in the Microsoft Edge browser. 

If you want to edit the main code (to affect display charateristics), open the content.js file in a text editor (Notepad in Windows)--play around.
